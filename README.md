Project Goal: Replace the role of a bodybuilding coach in the form of a website 
Advantages:
1) Convenience. An individual will be able to get coaching at will
2) Cost. The service will be free
3) Accuracy. We will provide sources and conflicting opinions on the scientific stances we take to maximize muscle growth

Sprints:
1) Minimum functional working product (80% ready. 1/19)
2) Design a webpage (Template picked out, need to finish redesigning it. 1/25)
3) Set up a server to run the code in these repositories (Server set up at home. Remote access works. 1/26)
4) Connect server to front end of the website
5) Create a .svg image of muscle groups to display weekly fatigue and color code it based on if you need more or less volume
